======

## Overview
Includes 3 different CFAR detectors:
* WISHART (Conradsen 2003)
* LogNormal (Crisp 2004)
* K-Distribution (Chen Liu 2015)

And 2 different detection transformations:
* DPolRad (Armando Marino 2018)
* Normalized Intensity Sum (Chen Liu 2015)

TODO:
* get warnings under control
* write documentation
* Add comments/headers to functions
* K-distribution sometimes fails at the image borders - maybe due to low amount of samples?
* Move mask_edges to somewhere else
* check warnings should also be moved somewhere
