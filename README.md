# cfar-object-detection :ice_cube: :mag:

Includes 3 different CFAR detectors:
* WISHART (Conradsen)
* LogNormal ()
* K-Distribution (Chen Liu)

And 2 different detection transformations:
* DPolRad (Armando Marino)
* Normalized Intensity Sum (Chen Liu)

TODO:
* get warnings under control
* write documentation
* Add comments/headers to functions
* K-distribution sometimes fails at the image borders - maybe due to low amount of samples?
